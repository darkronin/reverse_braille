# reverse_braille
Convert text to a reverse ("mirrored") braille string creating a crude matplotlib plot.

Reversing and mirroring characters is time-consuming and takes time away from learning braille so this program does it for you

The image generated with this program can be printed out and then the dots can be punched out by a sighted person. Then the text is readable as correct braille on the reverse of the page.

Use:
- enter any string/sentence/quote
- the program keeps asking for additional lines, until an empty string is entered ("press enter to exit")
- when the last string is entered, a plot is generated which can be then saved or printed.

  

Features:
- support multiline
- support full alphabet as per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_ASCII
- enter an empty string to exit

  

TODO:
- support printing full braille dots or only outlines to save ink
