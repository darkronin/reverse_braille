# reverse_braille
Convert text to a reverse braille string creating a crude matplotlib plot.

Reversing and mirroring characters is time-consuming and takes time away from learning braille so this program does it for you

Features:
- support multiline
- support full alphabet as per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_ASCII
- enter an empty string to exit

TODO:
- support printing full braille dots or only outlines to save ink
